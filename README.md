# React Router Dom v6 Routes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: routes not rendering correctly despite no apparent errors.  The problem typically lies in the improper structure or configuration of the routing component, specifically how the `Routes` and `Route` components are nested within the `BrowserRouter`.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy implementation, while `AppSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Bug
The initial implementation suffers from a subtle issue where the routes might not be correctly interpreted or matched by the router, leading to no page rendering.  This might be caused by various reasons such as incorrect path definitions, missing components, or an error in the routing setup.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the route definitions, ensuring that the paths are correct and accurately represent the intended navigation structure. This may also involve checking for typos or inconsistencies in the path strings or component names. It is also essential to double-check that all required components are properly imported and available to the routing system.  The corrected code in `AppSolution.js` shows how these issues are addressed for successful page navigation.
